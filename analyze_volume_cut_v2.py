""" Script to analyze the volume cut and its efficiency (either of positron or NC events):

    Version 2 (v2) means, that:
    - the volume cut efficiency is calculated independently of the other cuts.
    - filenumber and evtID of each event passing the volume cut is stored in file
    - all values of R_reco are stored in a histogram with the fiducial volume cut parameter R_FV

    1.  Set the cut parameter (R_FV)

    2.  read all NC events (user_atmoNC_0.root to user_atmoNC_999.root, each file contains 100 events.
        Therefore, 100000 events are analyzed.)
        or read all IBD events (user_IBD_hepevt_0.root to user_IBD_hepevt_199.root, each file contains 100
        events. Therefore, 20000 events are analyzed.)

    3.  analyze the events: do volume cut on the reconstructed position of the event

    4.  store filenumber and event number of the events, that pass the volume cut on recon. position into array and
        save it to file

    5.  store R_reco of all events in histogram and saved histogram with R_FV

    6.  analyze events also for the MC truth (initial) position

    7.  store also filenumber and event number of the events, that pass the volume cut on initial position (MC truth)
        into array and save it to file

    8.  calculate number of leak-in and leak-out events
