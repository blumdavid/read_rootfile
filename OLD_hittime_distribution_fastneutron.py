""" Script to read the root files from neutron simulation (representing fast neutron background) and saved their
    hittime distributions to txt file.

    These hittime distributions can then be analyzed further with OLD_pulse_shape_analysis_v1.py as reference to the prompt
    signal of IBD-like NC events (to compare hittime distributions of neutron and NC events).

    As simulated neutrons, the files user_neutron_10_MeV_{}.root, user_neutron_100_MeV_{}.root,
    user_neutron_300_MeV_{}.root and user_neutron_500_MeV_{}.root (from 'conversion_nPE_MeV') are used.

    Files user_neutron_10_MeV_0.root to user_neutron_10_MeV_99.root can not be used, because they deposit too less
    energy in the detector and therefore the hittime distribution has only a few ten entries (Qedep only from 0.2 MeV
    to 5 MeV).
    For files user_neutron_100_MeV_0.root to user_neutron_100_MeV_99.root, Qedep is from 1.2 MeV to 7.4 MeV.
    For files user_neutron_300_MeV_0.root to user_neutron_300_MeV_99.root, Qedep is from 1.5 MeV to 40 MeV.
    For files user_neutron_500_MeV_0.root to user_neutron_500_MeV_99.root, Qedep is from 0.0 MeV to 113 MeV.

    This is the same script like OLD_hittime_distribution_positron.py.

    Procedure to get the hittime distribution with vertex reconstruction and time smearing of PMTs:

    1.  apply same cuts like on prompt signals of NC events:
        1.1 energy cut on prompt signal: only neutrons with energy from 10 MeV to 100 MeV (here either 10 or 100 MeV)
            are simulated -> energy cut is applied automatically
        1.2 volume cut: must be same like for NC events (take initial position of initial particle -> smear it with
            vertex resolution with function position_smearing())

    2.  calculate time of flight:
        2.1 for every photon, that hits a PMT (20inch and 3inch), take the PMT position (via PMT ID from file
            PMT_position.root) and calculate the time-of-flight distance with the reconstructed position from above.
        2.2 with the time-of-flight distance, calculate the time-of-flight of this photon from production to PMT by
            considering an effective speed of light in the LS.

    3.  consider TTS of PMTs:
        3.1 for every photon, that hits a PMT (20inch and 3inch), take the time resolution (sigma) of the PMT
            (via PMT ID either from file PmtData.root for the 20inch PMTs or set TTS = 5 ns for 3inch PMTs.)
        3.2 the TTS of the PMT is FWHM. Therefore calculate sigma from TTS (FWHM = 2*sqrt(2*ln(2)) * sigma).
        3.3 smear hittime of detsim with gaussian of sigma (time resolution) around the value of detsim hittime to get
        the smeared hittime

    4.  for every photon, calculate the 'real' hittime (= smeared hittime - time_of_flight) and store it in array

    5.  Do points 2. to 4. for every photon. Then you get the correct hittime of this event. Build histogram with
        correct hittimes and save histogram value in txt file and display histogram in png file
