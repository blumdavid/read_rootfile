""" Script to analyze the NC events:

    Version 1:  the efficiencies are calculated depending on each other and no distributions of the cut parameters are
                saved.
                -> use Version 2: here the efficiencies are calculated independent of each other!

    Apply cut on the NC events to select IBD-like signals only.

    And get the energy and hittime distribution of the prompt signal of atmospheric NC neutrino background that
    are simulated with JUNO detector simulation.

    1.  read all NC events (user_atmoNC_0.root to user_atmoNC_999.root, each file contains 100 events.
        Therefore, 100000 events are analyzed.)

    2.  Start analyzing the events:
        2.1.    first analysis: do volume cut on the reconstructed position of the event
                (you only need InitX,Y,Z and sum of Qedep to get the reconstructed position).
                Only analyze event that pass volume cut further.

    3.  Calculate hittime distribution (with time-of-flight correction and PMT time resolution) for each event:
        Procedure to get the hittime distribution with vertex reconstruction and time smearing of PMTs (same procedure
        like in script OLD_hittime_distribution_positron.py):

        2.1.    calculate time of flight:
            2.1.1   for every photon, that hits a PMT (20inch and 3inch), take the PMT position (via PMT ID from file
                    PMT_position.root) and calculate the time-of-flight distance with the reconstructed position from
                    file evtID_preselected_{}.txt
            2.1.2   with the time-of-flight distance, calculate the time-of-flight of this photon from production to
                    PMT by considering an effective speed of light in the LS.

        2.2.    consider TTS of PMTs:
            2.2.1   for every photon, that hits a PMT (20inch and 3inch), take the time resolution (sigma) of the PMT
                    (via PMT ID either from file PmtData.root for the 20inch PMTs or set TTS = 5 ns for 3inch PMTs.)
            2.2.2   the TTS of the PMT is FWHM. Therefore calculate sigma from TTS (FWHM = 2*sqrt(2*ln(2)) * sigma).
            2.2.3   smear hittime of detsim with gaussian of sigma (time resolution) around the value of detsim hittime
                    to get the smeared hittime

        2.3.    for every photon, calculate the 'real' hittime (= smeared hittime - time_of_flight) and store it in
                array

        2.4.    Do points 2.1 to 2.3 for every photon. Then you get the correct hittime of this event. Build histogram
                with correct hittimes.

    3.  Take the prompt signal of the corrected hittime histogram and do a cut on the prompt signal:
        use function conversion_npe_to_evis() and convert the number of pe of the prompt signal to visible energy in
        MeV.
        Then apply energy resolution on the visible energy and do a cut on the visible energy (10 MeV to 100 MeV).
        Only analyze events further that pass prompt energy cut.

    4.  Analyze delayed signal:
        Take the delayed signal of the corrected hittime histogram and do several cuts on the delayed signal (time cut,
        delayed energy cut, multiplicity cut and distance cut):

        4.1.    analyze delayed signal with function analyze_delayed_signal(). With this you get:
            4.1.1.  if there is a delayed signal in the event
            4.1.2.  the number of pe in this delayed signal
            4.1.3.  the time, where signal begins and ends

            for all delayed signals in one event (there could also be several delayed signals in one event)

        4.2.    do time cut: begin and end time must be within delayed time window.
                Only analyze events that pass time cut further.
        4.3.    do delayed energy cut: take number of pe of each delayed signal, consider energy smearing to get the
                reconstructed energy and check if reconstructed energy is within delayed energy window.
                Only analyze events that pass delayed energy cut further.
        4.4.    do neutron multiplicity cut: check if there is only 1 delayed signal in the event that pass time and
                delayed energy cut.
                Only analyze events that pass multiplicity cut further.
        4.5.    do distance cut: distance between reconstructed position of prompt signal and reconstructed position of
                delayed signal must be smaller than cut-distance (normally 1.5 m).

        For the delayed cut, also the efficiency of the efficiency of the cuts must be determine (how many events are
        rejected/ pass falsely).

    5.  For events that pass all cuts:
        5.1.    Save the hittime histogram of the prompt signal to txt file and png file for further analysis with
                script OLD_pulse_shape_analysis_v1.py.

        5.2.    Save evtID and visible energy of prompt signal of each event in txt file.
